# Data & Storage Types in the Cloud 📂

Choosing where to store something in the cloud has everything to do with what's being stored. Just as you wouldn't store iced tea in a paper box, you need to select the right cloud storage option for your specific data type.

Understanding the difference between data types and storage types is the first step to properly managing and protecting information in the cloud.

## 1. Types of Data 📊

Data comes in two main forms, and each requires a different storage approach.

**Structured Data**
This is data that is highly organized in a predefined format, like **rows and columns** in a spreadsheet or database. This organization makes it very easy to search and analyze.
* **Examples:** Names, addresses, credit card numbers, dates.

**Unstructured Data**
This is data that is not organized in an easily identifiable way and is stored in its **native format**. It can't fit neatly into the rows and columns of a traditional database.
* **Examples:** Images, videos, audio files, and documents (.doc files).

## 2. Cloud Storage Options 🗄️

To handle these different data types, the cloud offers three main storage systems.

**File Storage**
This system organizes data in a familiar **hierarchy of files and folders**. Users navigate a logical path to find what they need. It is the oldest and most widely used system.
* **Best for:** Smaller data volumes, shared files for a few users (like a family computer), and developer data repositories.
* **Limitation:** Can only handle so much data before performance suffers.

**Object Storage**
This system holds unstructured data as "objects" inside virtual containers called **buckets**. Each bucket has a unique name and can be configured to be public or private.
* **Best for:** Storing and organizing massive amounts of unstructured data.
* **Key Feature:** Highly scalable and great for data like images, videos, and backups.

**Block Storage**
In this system, data is split into smaller, independent **blocks**, and each is given a unique ID. When the data is needed, the system quickly reassembles the blocks.
* **Best for:** High-performance needs like databases or applications requiring fast, consistent access.
* **Key Feature:** Very flexible and efficient, as it can be used by any operating system or virtual machine.
