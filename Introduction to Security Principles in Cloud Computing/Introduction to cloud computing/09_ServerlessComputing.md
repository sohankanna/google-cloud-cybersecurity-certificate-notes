# Serverless Computing üë®‚Äçüíª

**Serverless computing** is a cloud computing model where the cloud service provider (CSP) fully manages the servers and infrastructure. Despite the name, servers do exist; they are simply abstracted away from the developer, who can focus entirely on writing and deploying code.

## Serverless Service Models

Serverless computing is primarily delivered through two cloud service models:

* **Backend as a Service (BaaS):** In this model, the CSP manages all backend infrastructure, including servers, containers, and virtual machines. Developers use BaaS to speed up the creation of applications by focusing on the frontend code. BaaS often includes access to managed services like databases, file storage, and authentication.
* **Function as a Service (FaaS):** This model runs small, ephemeral pieces of code called **functions**. A function is short-lived, triggered by an event (e.g., a customer signing up), and then expires. FaaS allows developers to use their preferred programming languages and only pay for the time the function is running. Google Cloud Functions is an example of a FaaS product.

## Benefits of Serverless Computing

* **Scalability:** Resources automatically scale up or down based on demand, following a **pay-as-you-go** model. You only pay for the resources you use.
* **Increased Productivity:** Developers can focus on writing application code rather than managing backend infrastructure, leading to faster development and deployment.

## Security in Serverless Computing üîê

While the CSP manages the underlying infrastructure security, organizations still have a shared responsibility for security in a serverless environment.

* **Shared Responsibility:** Organizations are responsible for protecting their data, functions from vulnerabilities, and managing resource access.
* **Short-Lived Functions:** The short lifespan of functions is a built-in security benefit. Attackers have a very limited window to exploit a vulnerability.
* **Limited Impact:** If an attacker were to compromise a function, they could only affect the small part of the application that uses that specific function, limiting the scope of the attack.
