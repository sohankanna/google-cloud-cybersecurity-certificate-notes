# Composition of the Cloud ☁️

## Core Components: Data Centers, Zones, and Regions

The cloud is built on a physical infrastructure of **data centers**. A data center is a building that houses the servers, computer systems, and associated components that provide computing power for cloud services.

* **Zone:** A group of one or more data centers in a specific, contained geographical area.
* **Region:** A collection of multiple zones. Cloud providers like Google Cloud have many regions worldwide, which are constantly growing.

## Resiliency and Redundancy

To ensure high availability and protect against disruptions, cloud providers use **failure domains**. A failure domain is a resource (e.g., a zone or region) that can fail without affecting the overall availability of data.

* **Resiliency:** The ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions. Cloud providers achieve resiliency by replicating data across different failure domains.
* **Redundancy:** The practice of creating multiple copies of data in different locations. This is essential for avoiding a single point of failure and ensuring data is available when needed.

## Data Transmission and Latency

### Latency

**Latency** is the time it takes for data to travel from one location to another. This can be from a user's device to a cloud server or between cloud servers.

* **Low Latency:** A low latency connection means data travels quickly, which results in a faster user experience (e.g., quicker website loading times).
* **Why it's important:** Low latency is a key component of an organization's **digital transformation**, which involves using new technologies to modernize services and improve the user experience.

The cloud's ability to scale and globally replicate data helps organizations provide a better user experience to both their employees and customers.
