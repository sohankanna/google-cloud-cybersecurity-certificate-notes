# Ephemerality and Cloud Resources ‚è≤Ô∏è

The concept of **ephemerality** is central to cloud computing. Ephemerality is the idea that things exist for only a short time, meaning change in the cloud is constant. Cloud resources, such as servers, are designed to be created and destroyed quickly to adapt to new needs.

* **Security Benefit:** Ephemeral resources are less vulnerable to attack because cybercriminals have a very small window of time to find and exploit a vulnerability before the resource is retired or replaced.
* **Operational Benefit:** Instead of patching an old server, a cloud security analyst can simply launch a new, healthy server image, ensuring the infrastructure is always up-to-date and secure.

# Core Cloud Resources üß†

Cloud computing is a practice of using on-demand resources as services over the internet. These resources can be broadly categorized into three main areas: compute, storage, and networks.

## 1. Compute

**Compute** refers to the computational power provided by remote servers, including components like memory, CPU, and processing power.

* **Benefit:** Organizations can efficiently scale their compute resources up or down to meet changing demands. For example, an e-commerce website can automatically scale its compute resources during a busy sales season and then scale back down to a normal workload when demand decreases.

## 2. Storage

**Cloud data storage** allows organizations to store, access, and manage digital data on off-site, cloud-based devices managed by the CSP.

* **Benefit:** This eliminates the need for organizations to manage their own physical storage hardware, providing a flexible and scalable solution for data management.

## 3. Networks

Unlike traditional networks that rely on physical devices, cloud networks are managed using software.

* **Benefit:** **Software-defined networking** allows users to change their network designs and configurations without needing to purchase or replace physical hardware. This also provides better visibility into network traffic.
