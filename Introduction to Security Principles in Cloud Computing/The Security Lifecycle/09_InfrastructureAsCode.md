# What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is a practice that automates the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure using code. This approach replaces manual configuration, making the process more efficient, repeatable, and less prone to human error. IaC is a fundamental tool in the **DevSecOps** toolkit.

It typically uses a **declarative** model, where you define the desired final state of your infrastructure (e.g., specifying a virtual machine with certain properties). The IaC tool then automatically handles the steps needed to reach that state.

### Key Benefits of IaC
Adopting IaC offers numerous benefits for organizations and cloud professionals:

* **Cost Reduction**: It decreases the time, effort, and complexity of managing cloud resources, freeing up developers to work on other tasks and eliminating the need for physical hardware.
* **Reduces Human Error**: By removing manual steps, IaC minimizes the risk of mistakes and uncoordinated changes that can lead to misconfigurations or security vulnerabilities.
* **Increased Efficiency**: IaC enables teams to deploy the same infrastructure consistently across the development lifecycle, ensuring the CI/CD pipeline runs smoothly. This automation accelerates the speed of delivery.
* **Reduces Configuration Drift**: IaC prevents **configuration drift**, which is when a resourceâ€™s configuration deviates from its intended state. It does this by using a single configuration file as the "source of truth" and enforcing consistency through automation.
* **Enhanced Accountability**: Storing infrastructure code in a shared repository increases visibility. All changes are tracked, making it easier for teams to collaborate and review modifications.
* **Integrated Security**: Security checks can be automated at the infrastructure level. Regular scans can be used to detect policy violations and security flaws in the code before the infrastructure is provisioned.
