# **Software Pipelines & Google Cloud Build**
***
**Software pipelines** are automated processes that efficiently move code through the software development lifecycle. They are central to **DevSecOps** because they support **"shifting left,"** or integrating security from the very beginning. The **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery)** pipeline is a common type of software pipeline that automates the building, testing, and deployment of applications. Google Cloud's **Cloud Build** is a service that facilitates this.

### **Security in a CI/CD Pipeline üõ°Ô∏è**
***
Security is integrated throughout the CI/CD pipeline using automation to create a robust and secure workflow.

1.  **Source & Build Stage**: As source code is committed, it's automatically scanned for vulnerabilities. This triggers a build that becomes an image.
2.  **Artifact Repository**: The image is then scanned for vulnerabilities and policy violations before it's stored in an artifact repository. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** permissions control who can access these images.
3.  **Continuous Scanning**: The stored images are regularly scanned for new vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability is detected, automation can trigger a patch and redeployment.
4.  **Deployment**: Access to deployment is restricted to **service accounts** (non-human identities) to reduce human error and provide granular control.

### **Google Cloud Build**
***
**Cloud Build** is a serverless Google Cloud service that automates the build and security of software. It can pull code from various repositories, execute build steps, and create artifacts like container images.

* **Vulnerability Scanning**: It can scan container images for vulnerabilities and check for compliance requirements.
* **Build Consistency**: Cloud Build automates the build process, which improves consistency and reduces the chance of human error.
* **Security Insights**: It provides insights into the health of builds, helping organizations identify bugs and address errors.

Understanding how to integrate security into software pipelines is crucial for a cloud security professional as it‚Äôs a foundational element of modern development.
