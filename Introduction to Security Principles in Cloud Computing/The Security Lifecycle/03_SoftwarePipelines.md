# Software Pipelines

### The Waterfall Methodology: A Traditional Approach
***
The **waterfall methodology** is a sequential, step-by-step approach to software development. Each phase must be completed before the next one can begin, creating a one-directional flow. The typical phases are:

1.  **Requirements**
2.  **Design**
3.  **Development**
4.  **Testing**
5.  **Release**
6.  **Maintenance**

While this method is clearly defined, it has significant drawbacks:
* **Rigidity**: It's difficult and costly to revert to a previous step if issues are found.
* **Bottlenecks**: A single problem can halt the entire project, as other teams are blocked from proceeding.
* **Delays**: The linear nature of the workflow can cause projects to fall behind schedule if issues arise.

### Software Pipelines: A Modern, Agile Solution
***
A **software pipeline** is an automated process that facilitates the movement of software through the development lifecycle, and it is a core component of **DevSecOps**. It addresses the limitations of the waterfall method by:

* **Using Automation**: Pipelines automate tasks like integration, testing, code validation, and security scans. This creates a consistent and reliable process.
* **Enabling Continuous Feedback**: Unlike the waterfall method, which tests at the end, pipelines integrate testing and security checks throughout the entire lifecycle. This "shifts left," allowing issues to be found and fixed early.
* **Improving Efficiency**: Developers can make small, modular changes to an application without disrupting the entire project, enabling faster and more frequent releases.
* **Fostering Collaboration**: The pipeline workflow promotes seamless collaboration between development, security, and operations teams, allowing them to build and secure applications together.
