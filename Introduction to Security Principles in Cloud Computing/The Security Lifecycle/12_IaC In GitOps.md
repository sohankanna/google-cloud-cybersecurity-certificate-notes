# What is GitOps?
**GitOps** is a framework that automates cloud infrastructure and application management using **Git** as the single source of truth. It applies DevOps principles like version control and CI/CD to infrastructure, ensuring that all changes are declarative and auditable.

### Key Principles and Components
* **Declarative Infrastructure**: Infrastructure is defined as code (**IaC**) and stored in a Git repository.
* **Version Control**: The Git repository is the central hub for all infrastructure and application configurations. All changes are tracked, and the **main branch** serves as the desired state of the production environment.
* **Pull Requests**: To update infrastructure, a developer creates a new branch, makes their changes, and submits a **pull request**. This allows for code review, collaboration, and automated checks before changes are merged into the main branch.
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitOps relies on automated CI/CD pipelines to apply changes. When a pull request is merged, the pipeline automatically detects the change and synchronizes the live infrastructure to match the state of the Git repository.

### Benefits of GitOps
* **Improved Security**: GitOps supports the **"shift left"** approach by integrating security checks into the pull request workflow. Automated security scans and compliance checks can run on every proposed change before it's deployed.
* **Enhanced Visibility**: Every change to the infrastructure is a Git commit, creating a clear, auditable history of who made what changes and when.
* **Consistency and Reliability**: The Git repository acts as the "source of truth," ensuring that the live environment is always in sync with the defined configuration, which prevents **configuration drift**.
* **Faster Deployments**: Automation removes manual steps and bottlenecks, allowing teams to deliver changes and updates more quickly and reliably.
