# The Shared Fate Model ü§ù

The **shared fate model** is an advanced evolution of the shared responsibility model. It emphasizes a **stronger partnership** between the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and the customer, with the CSP taking a more active role in the customer's entire security journey.

### Purpose and Distinction from Shared Responsibility

The shared fate model addresses the inherent challenges of the shared responsibility model, such as:
* Navigating complex and changing regulations.
* Understanding how different security controls overlap.
* Managing security as an ongoing, continuous process.

This model aims to **increase the level of trust** between the customer and the CSP by having the CSP invest more time and resources to help the customer design, deploy, and operate their cloud environment securely.

### Key Ways the Shared Fate Model Builds Trust

The shared fate model goes beyond simply providing services and offers proactive guidance and tools to customers.

**1. Security Foundations for Users**
* The CSP provides **best practices or blueprints** for securely configuring and deploying cloud services.
* This allows customers to deploy secure solutions using **infrastructure as code**, ensuring consistency and security from the start.

**2. Landing Zones**
* A **landing zone** is a pre-configured, modular, and scalable environment that provides a secure foundation for a customer to begin their cloud adoption.
* The CSP offers guidance on configuring these zones, which include initial setups for identity provisioning, resource hierarchy, and network and security controls.

**3. Mitigating Risk**
* The CSP provides tools and programs to help customers manage and mitigate risk.
* **Google's Risk Protection Program** and its **Risk Manager** tool are examples. Risk Manager provides insights into an organization's technical risk posture and can generate reports to evaluate risk across the entire organization.
