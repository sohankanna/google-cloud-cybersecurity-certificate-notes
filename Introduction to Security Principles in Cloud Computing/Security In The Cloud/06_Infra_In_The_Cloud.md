## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

### What is IaaS?
* IaaS is a **cloud computing model** where the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) provides on-demand access to fundamental computing resources.
* These resources include **servers, storage, networking, and virtualization**.

### Benefits of IaaS
* **Scalability:** Resources can be **increased or decreased on-demand** to accommodate changing workloads.
    * **Example:** A university can scale up its IT infrastructure during student enrollment and final exams, and then scale back down during breaks.
* **Cost Savings:** The CSP pays for and maintains the underlying equipment.
    * Customers **only pay for the resources they use**, which can free up budget for other needs.
* **Increased Productivity:** The CSP manages the physical infrastructure, allowing an organization's IT teams to focus on managing **infrastructure services and security**.

### Security Responsibilities
* In an IaaS model, the **customer holds the majority of the security responsibilities**.
* The CSP secures the underlying physical infrastructure, but the customer is responsible for **securing data, operations, and access and authentication**.

### Migrating to IaaS
* The **"lift and shift" migration model** is a common method for moving workloads to IaaS.
* This model involves moving workloads to the cloud with **little to no modifications**.
* It is a **fast and simple** way to migrate, as it requires fewer changes and less adjustment time for teams.
