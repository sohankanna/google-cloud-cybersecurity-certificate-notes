# Shared Responsibility Challenges ⚠️

While the shared responsibility model has benefits, it also introduces challenges that security professionals must navigate.

***

## 1. Misconfiguration
**Misconfiguration** is the most common challenge and a leading cause of cloud security breaches. It happens when security settings are not configured correctly, often due to the complexity and rapid evolution of cloud technology.

* **Consequences:** Misconfigurations can leave data exposed, leading to major security breaches and regulatory fines.
* **Prevention:**
    * Closely monitor **resource provisioning**.
    * Incorporate **automation** and strong security policies.
    * Properly manage **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** policies.
    * Adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, which grants users the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks, reducing risk.

## 2. Inconsistent Security Across Multiple Services
Large companies often use a variety of cloud services from different CSPs. This can create security vulnerabilities if the company and CSPs don't closely monitor the security of and relationships between these services.

* **Challenge:** Ensuring consistent security policies and controls across diverse and potentially complex cloud environments.

***

## 3. Regulatory and Market Changes
As a company grows, acquires other businesses, or expands into new markets, its security needs and regulatory obligations can change.

* **Challenge:** Companies must track and comply with evolving security guidelines and regulations, especially when operating in multiple countries with different legal frameworks. This can impact established **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** and required security controls.

## 4. Keeping Up with Threats
Security is an ongoing process. Threats and vulnerabilities are constantly changing, and a security team must stay up-to-date to effectively protect the business.

* **Challenge:** The need for continuous education and vigilance to counter new and evolving threats.
