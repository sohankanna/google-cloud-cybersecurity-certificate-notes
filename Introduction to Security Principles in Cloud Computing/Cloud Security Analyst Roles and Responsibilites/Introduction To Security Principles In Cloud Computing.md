# Introduction To Security Principles In Cloud Computing

Cloud security is a rapidly growing field with diverse job opportunities across many industries. As a cloud security analyst, you can specialize in several key areas.

## 1. Information Risk Management

This field focuses on **identifying, assessing, and minimizing potential threats** to an organization's information assets.

* **Core Responsibilities:**
    * **Develop Security Strategies:** Create plans for securing cloud assets.
    * **Asset Inventory:** Understand and manage the organization's cloud environment, often using cloud asset inventory software.
    * **Threat Research:** Investigate potential threats and implement controls to mitigate risks.
    * **Budget Planning:** Prioritize security spending based on the value of assets. The higher the asset's value, the more should be invested in its protection.

## 2. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

CSPM is the process of **monitoring and configuring cloud assets** to ensure they comply with security best practices, regulations, and internal policies.

* **What is Security Posture?**
    * An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and to react to change.

* **Core Responsibilities:**
    * **Centralized Monitoring:** Use tools like **Google Cloud Security Command Center** to find and analyze information about the cloud environment.
    * **Identify Weaknesses:** Monitor for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
    * **Policy Management:** Regularly review and update security policies, especially for **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.
    * **Implement Controls:** Put security controls in place and test them regularly.
    * **Vendor Collaboration:** Review security posture with cloud service providers to ensure features are up-to-date.
    * **Communication:** Clearly explain technical security concepts to non-technical audiences, such as management and users.
    * **Education:** Train colleagues on security best practices.

## 3. Threat Intelligence

This field involves the **collection, analysis, and evaluation of cyberthreat information** to stay ahead of attackers.

* **What are Cyberthreats?**
    * Techniques used by malicious actors to damage cloud resources or gain unauthorized access to data.

* **Core Responsibilities:**
    * **Proactive Defense:** Use documented information on attack groups, their methods, and system vulnerabilities to anticipate and prevent attacks.
    * **Resource Allocation:** Help direct budget and resources toward the organization's most vulnerable areas.
    * **Incident Response:** When an attack occurs, analysts are responsible for minimizing the impact and supporting the recovery process.
